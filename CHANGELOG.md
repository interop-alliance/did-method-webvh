## 3.2.0 - 2026-06-24

### Added

* export `deriveNextKeyHash` from the package entry, so callers implementing
  key pre-rotation can compute the committed `nextKeyHashes` value
  (`base58btc(multihash_sha2_256(sha256(utf8Bytes(publicKeyMultibase))))`)
  without reaching into internal module paths.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-06-15

### Added

* support `capabilityDelegation` and `capabilityInvocation` as verification
  relationship options on `createDID` / `updateDID` (alongside the existing
  `authentication`, `assertionMethod`, and `keyAgreement` passthroughs), so a
  single verification method can be referenced by id across all five
  relationships -- matching the `did:web` shape -- instead of being limited to
  the one relationship implied by its `purpose`.
* a verification method's `purpose` may now be an **array** of relationships
  (`DataIntegrityProofPurpose[]`), not just a single value. A key declared with
  `purpose: ['authentication', 'assertionMethod', 'capabilityDelegation',
  'capabilityInvocation']` is added once to `verificationMethod` and referenced
  by id from each listed relationship -- the ergonomic way to produce the
  `did:web` shape without building relationship-id strings by hand. A single
  string still works; absent (or empty) still defaults to `authentication`.
* export `DID_PLACEHOLDER` (the `{DID}` substitution token) and `createVMID`
  from the package entry, so callers can construct verification-method id
  references (e.g. `` `${DID_PLACEHOLDER}#${publicKeyMultibase.slice(-8)}` ``)
  without depending on internal magic strings.

### Changed

* `normalizeVMs` no longer copies the creation-time `purpose` directive onto the
  emitted `verificationMethod` entries; `purpose` is not a DID Core
  verification-method property and previously leaked into the published DID
  document. The relationship arrays (`authentication`, etc.) are unaffected.

## 3.0.0-3.0.2 - 2026-06-14

### Package

* rename the package from `didwebvh-ts` to `@interop/did-method-webvh` and move
  the repository to `interop-alliance/did-method-webvh`; update import specifiers
  and docs accordingly (the `didwebvh` CLI bin name is unchanged)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* remove the legacy `did:webvh:0.5` spec implementation (`src/method_versions/method.v0.5.ts`); the library now supports `did:webvh:1.0` only:
  * resolving a DID log whose first entry declares `method: 'did:webvh:0.5'` (including via `updateDID`/`deactivateDID`, which resolve the log internally) throws `'did:webvh:0.5' is not a supported method version.`
  * `createDID` throws the same error if passed an explicit non-1.0 `method` option (previously an untyped option that selected the v0.5 implementation)
* remove "controlled-mode" local file resolution from the library; it now lives in `examples/express-resolver.ts`:
  * `resolveDID` no longer consults the `DID_VERIFICATION_METHODS` env var or reads DID logs from the local `./src/routes/` directory; it always resolves over HTTPS
  * `resolveDID` no longer returns a `controlled` field in its result (success or error)
  * `fetchLogFromIdentifier` loses its second (`controlled`) parameter
  * the internal `getActiveDIDs` helper is removed (it was not exported from the package entry point)
  * the `src/routes/` fixture data moves to `examples/routes/`
  * servers that control their own DID logs should read the log file themselves and call the existing `resolveDIDFromLog` export (see `resolveDIDLocalFirst` in `examples/express-resolver.ts` for a reference implementation)

### Build System

* replace the esbuild multi-bundle build (ESM/CJS/browser/CLI) with a plain `tsc` build emitting a single ESM target plus declarations to `dist/`; the `require` entry point is dropped (Node >= 20.19 can `require()` ESM natively)
* remove unused dependencies (`cookie`, `glob`, `js-yaml`) and unused dev dependencies (`esbuild`, `@sinclair/typebox`, `@types/express`)
* move `@stablelib/ed25519` to `dependencies` (the unbundled CLI imports it at runtime)
* the CLI now ships as `dist/cli.js` (was `dist/cli/didwebvh.js`); the `didwebvh` bin name is unchanged
* upgrade `vitest` from v3 to v4 (no test or config changes required)

### Tests

* add test coverage measurement: `@vitest/coverage-v8` dev dependency and a `test:coverage` script (informational only, no thresholds; the CLI is exercised via subprocesses, which V8 coverage cannot see)
* add tests for the HTTPS resolution path (`resolveDID`, `fetchLogFromIdentifier`, `fetchWitnessProofs`) using a stubbed global `fetch`, covering success, 404/notFound mapping, empty and invalid logs, SCID mismatch, and network failure
* add unit tests for multibase/multihash decode error branches, the buffer utilities (both Node and browser paths), and the hash helpers
